## 🌟 What do we do?

We are building a Agent platform to create innovative, scalable, and integrative AI solutions. Our flagship project, **[open-responses](https://github.com/masaic-ai-platform/open-responses)**, is a unified API that bridges multiple LLM providers through a standardized OpenAI-like interface.

## Current Project

A powerful API that lets you:
- Use one codebase across various LLM providers

- Leverage built-in tools for enhanced capabilities

## 🔥 Hosted Services & More

We are actively expanding our ecosystem. Expect more projects and hosted solutions soon that empower you to build the next generation of AI agents.
