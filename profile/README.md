# Hi there, we are [Masaic AI Platform](https://masaic.ai/)! 🚀

## 🌟 What do we do?

We are building **AgC** - an open-core platform that powers **Open Agentic Compute**, a new compute substrate purpose-built for deploying, running, and orchestrating AI agents at scale.

Our flagship project, **[AgC](https://github.com/openagenticcompute/AgC)**, treats agents as first-class compute units. Think of it as what EC2 did for VMs — but for agents. Modular, observable, cloud-neutral, and production-ready.

## Current Project

### [AgC - Open Agentic Compute Platform](https://github.com/openagenticcompute/AgC)
A comprehensive agentic orchestration platform that provides:

- 🔧 **Built-in agentic tool/function calling**
- ✅ **Built-in Remote MCP server Integrations**
- 🔍 **Built-in Search + RAG**
- 🧠 **Built-in Agentic state + memory**
- 🎯 **Built-in agent orchestration capabilities**

**Core Components:**
- **Platform Server**: Agentic orchestration API layer with built-in tools
- **Platform UI**: Web interface for agent development and management
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose configurations for various deployment modes

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

- **Agentic Orchestration**: Multi-agent workflows and collaboration
- **Model Agnostic**: Works with any LLM provider through OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Self-Hosted**: Full control of deployment infrastructure
- **Production Ready**: Built-in tracing, monitoring, and observability
- **Open Source**: Apache 2.0 licensed, community-driven development

## 🔥 What's Next

We are actively expanding our ecosystem to empower developers and organizations to run agents like cloud-native workloads — at scale, and without lock-in.
